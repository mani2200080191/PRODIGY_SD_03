Contact Management Program in Python

I recently developed a Python program to efficiently manage contact information. The program allows users to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. For persistent storage, it utilizes a JSON file. This project showcases fundamental concepts like file handling, JSON manipulation, and basic CRUD operations in Python.
